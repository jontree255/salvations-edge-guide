## Encounter

### Getting Glyphbreaker Buffs
- 3 types of Witness hands will appear. Each casts a different attack and standing in the attack grants a different Resonance buff after you stand in the attack for a short time..
  - Ceiling Hands - Casts Triangle attack - Pyramidal Resonance
  - Floor Hands - Casts Circle attack - Spherical Resonance
  - Wall Hands  - Casts Beam/Square attack - Hexehedron Resonance
- Each hand has a bracelet on it that is vulnerable by standing in the matching attack the hand is casting. 
- You do not need to get the buff to stun the hand the first time.
  - Example: To stun the Floor Hand. Quickly stand in the Circle attack and shoot the Floor Hand's bracelet. 
- When a Hand is stunned the bracelet will turn one of three colors. Red, Yellow, or Green. 
- The color will never be what the Hand is casting.
- This color tells the shooter which Resonance they need to get next.
  - Red - Square - Hexehedron Resonance
  - Yellow - Circle - Spherical Resonance
  - Green - Triangle - Pyramidal Resonance
- The shooter then finds the attack that matches the color they need and stands in the attack till they get the corresponding resonance buff.
- Shooter then returns to their assigned hand and shoots it again by standing in the attack the hand is casting.
  - NOTE: The shooter must quickly shoot the hand while in the attack so the buff they took from the other hand does not get overwritten.
- Shooter now has the Glyphbreaker buff. 
- Once all 3 Glyphbreakers have the buff they go to the middle and shoot buttons off one side of the Witness. 

### Witness Tests
- Occurs between getting 2-5 Glyphbreaker buffs immediately after somone makes a Glyphbreaker buff. 
- The Hand the player just shot will scream and split into tentacles and the flavor text will show in the bottom left of the screen
- Whatever color the screaming hand was is the shape that needs to be made in front of the Witness.
- The Witness will spawn 14 Resonance splinters in front of it. 
- The team needs to shoot out/remove resonance splinters to make the shape that matches the screaming hand's color.
  - Triangle - Shoot 3 splinters on the top right and top left
  - Square - Shoot all internal splinters. (Leave only outermost splinters).
  - Circle - Shoot the corners and the two splinters closest to the Witness' head. (this actually forms a diamond).
- See cheat sheet below for which Splinters to shoot for which shape.
- If the test is passed the Witness will do a slam attack you must jump over.
- Listen for a Ping noise and jump when you hear it. (Sounds like Mechabre sniper)



### Damage Phase
- Begins once all buttons are broken on the Witness' chest
- Everyone goes to middle plate and the plate rises up.
- During DPS the Witness will be casing beam attacks that cover almost half the plate at a diagonal angle and a slam attack.
  - Taking the entire beam attack or getting slammed will kill you. 
  - The Witness alternates its beam attacks from left to right. 
  - The slam attack is when it casts both hands straight at the plate. 
    - Sometimes the slam is fast
    - Sometimes the slam is slow
    - Sometims it doesn't happen at all.
    - Each slam attack only happens once per DPS phase. 
  - The ground will light up with the danger zone.
  - Look and do not rely on callouts.
- The Witness will do 3 sets of attacks with small pauses between them. Do damage at any opportunity.
- THE MOST IMPORTANT THING IS TO STAY ALIVE. EVEN IF IT COSTS YOU DAMAGE. 
- At the end of damage the Witness will slam the platform down with its hands. Leave the platform before this happens.
- DO NOT PUSH FOR FINAL STAND TILL YOU HAVE AMMO

## REPEAT UNTIL FINAL STAND

## Final Stand
- Final Stand is not easy.
- Make sure you have full ammo and supers
- The Witness performs one set of attacks and then goes immune.
