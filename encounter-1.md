## Encounter

### First Phase - Tormentor

- One Team will reach an Overload. Kill it to spawn Tormentor in the middle.
- Entire raid team returns to middle to kill tormentor.
- REPEAT FIRST PHASE 

### Second Phase - Ping Pong
- Teams run through their rooms again looking for an active resonance conduit.
  - The plate in the room with the active resonance conduit is the start + end plate for the ping pong. 
- Split each team into a pair of people who will ping and a roamer. 
  - Ping Pair
   - Ping person 1 pings the plate in the room with the active conduit by stepping on and off the plate. 
   - Watch which circuit the energy travels on to find the receiving plate and let the ping fail. 
   - Ping person 2 goes to the recieving plate. 
   - Once the pair is ready ping person 1 starts the ping. 
   - Ping person 2 waits for the energy to hit their plate and steps on then off to ping it back to Ping person 1. 
   - Each time a ping is returned a triangle resonance pickup is spawned in the room OR in the center room. 
   - Each ping person alternates between pinging their plate, picking up resonance, and clearing adds. 
   - Once Ping person 1 has 3 stacks they shoot the resonance conduit and step on their plate as a ping is incoming to turn off the circuit. 
    - Shooing the conduit will remove a stack of resonance from the shooter and despawn all resonance created by that conduit. 
  - Roamers
   - Move around between room killing adds.
   - Look for resonance that spawns in the center room. 
- Once both conduits are turned off a subjugator will spawn in the middle room
- Entire raid team returns to middle.
- Kill subjugator to spawn the dunk chest. Team dunks all resonance to reset the timer.
