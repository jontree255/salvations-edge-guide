# Encounter 3

## Objective
- Dunk Resonance stacks in middle chest to reset timer and progress through 3 rooms.

## Wipe/Death Mechanic(s)
- Final Shape Looming Timer runs out.
- Picking up 4 stacks of resonance.

## Setup
- Build for add clear, survivability, and Tormentor killing.
- Have Unstoppable stunning capability
- Split into three teams of 2. Each pair has one "reader". The "reader" will take the plate closest to the exit on their pair. 
- Teams go left, right, and middle. 
- Each area has two ping plates and a resonance conduit on the plate near the exit of the room.
- Resonance conduits can now have either a triangle, a sphere, or a box and require matching resonance to shut them off.
- Player who gets last hit on a Tormentor recieves the buff that allows them to see what shape is needed to shut off the conduit. This person is the "reader"

## Encounter
- Each room is different but has 6 plate split into 3 pairs.
- Adds spawn in with 3 Tormentors. The "readers" should get last hit on the Tormentors.
- After killing the Tormentor Cabal turrets spawn. Kill these ASAP. 
- Begin ping ponging after Conduit shapes are identified. 
- Ping pong works the same as the previous encounters with the addition of a 3rd shape.
- Resonance shapes are going to spawn further away from the plates and it becomes near impossible to get shapes AND ping the plates.
- You can spawn the resonance objects and then intentionally fail the final ping. This will spawn a Subjugator who must be killed to activate the plates again.
- Once you kill the subjugator you can freely pick up your objects. Activate the plates again and complete the ping pong process to charge the conduit and turn it off.
- Kill and Unstoppable Ogre at the exit door of the room to open it and get to the next room.  
- As you progress through the rooms the circuits will begin to cross over each other. See below for rough image guide.
- Gather resonance and dunk in the chests after turning off the conduits in 3 rooms to complete the encounter.
