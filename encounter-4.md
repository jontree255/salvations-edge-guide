- Memorize the following shape additions
  - Circle + Circle = Sphere
  - Square + Square = Cube

  - Cylinder - Square = Circle
  - Cylinder - Circle = Square
  - Cone - Triangle = Circle
  - Cone - Circle = Triangle
  - Prisim - Triangle = Square
  - Prisim - Square = Triangle
- EVERYONE NEEDS TO KNOW THESE EQUATIONS
- Label the pedestals in front of the spawn 1-6 and make sure everytone knows them. 


## Encounter
- The raid group will be randomly split into two teams.
  - 3 Players will be put into separate rooms as solos. The Solo Team
  - The remaining 3 players will stay in the spawn room. The Group Team.
- Periodically throughout the encounter the Witness will kill and freeze random players on the Solo Team.
  - To revive a player you must pick up their Ghost and take it to the corresponding statue of the guardian.
  - The person who picks up the Ghost CANNOT see which statue is where. The dead Guardians can.
  - Dead Guardians are looking for glowing yellow statues at the pedestals labeled 1-6. 
  - Dead guardians must direct the player who picks up the Ghost to the correct statue. 
  - If deposited in the correct statue the player will unfreeze where they were and can continue.

### Solo Team (Inside Team)
- Look to the back of the room for the 3 statues.
- Call out to the Group the order of the shapes from left to right. They will be the same for all members of the Solo team.
- Identify which statue is you and which shape the statue is holding. 
- You are trying to get the other two shapes your statue is NOT holding.
  - To make this easier you want to first get only the shape your statue IS holding to drop in your room.
- Look at the back wall which will switch between two shapes. This indicates which shapes are dropping in your room. 
- Kill the knights that spawn to make them drop a shape. Don't kill them unless you need a shape. 
- Take the shape to the corresponding statue holding it and give it to that staute.
  - This sends the shape to that person's room. 
  - If your back wall is showing your statue's shape and one other shape you only need to kill one knight and deposit one shape
  - If you don't see your statue's shape on the back wall you'll need to kill two knights and deposit two shapes. 
- Kill Orges to spawn more knights. 
- Once each solo player's wall is only showing their statue's shape it's time to give them to the other players. 
- Kill a knight and give the shape to the other two statues NOT holding that shape. 
- Now each solo player's room should be dropping the two shapes their statue DOES NOT have. 
- Each player kills two knights to get both shapes and form the 3D object they need to exit their room.

### Group Team (Outside Team)
- Select one person to move shapes once the teams are split. This person is the "Mover".
- The other two are on add clear and/or Ghost duty. They must also deal with Unstoppable champs. 
- The mover listens to the callouts from the solo team. 
- Mover must look at the 3 statues in the back of their room that are holding 3D objects. 
- The mover must create the 3D objects on the 3 statues in the back that DO NOT contain the shape that the statues of the Solo Team have.
- Example:
   - Solo team has Triangle, Circle, Square from left to right
   - The Mover needs to create Cylinder, Prisim, Cone from left to right. 
- The mover creates new shapes by SUBTRACTING from a 3D object and SWAPPING it to another 3D object.
  - The Mover will normally only need to make 2 swaps or 4 statue interactions to create the proper shapes.
  - If they Mover has all 3 double 3D objects (Pyramid, Cube, Sphere) they will need to make 3 swaps. 
- To choose which shape to subtract/swap, kill a knight and pick up their shape.
- Left Kight always drops Circle. Middle always drops Triangle. Right always drops Square. 
- Example:
  - Solo team has Triangle, Circle, Square from left to right.
  - Mover has Cone, Prisim, Cylinder from left to right. 
  - The Mover needs to create Cylinder, Prisim, Cone from left to right.
  - Left statue cannot have a triangle, middle statue cannot have a circle, and right statue cannot have a square.
  - 1st Dissection
    - Mover kills Right knight and puts Square into Right Statue
    - Mover kills Middle knight and puts Triangle into Middle Statue
  - Mover now has Cone, Cube, Cone.
  - 2nd Dissection
    - Mover kills Middle knight and puts Triangle into Left Statue
    - Mover kills Right knight and puts Square into Middle Statue.
  - Mover now has Cylinder, Prisim, Cone.
  - Solo Players can now exit their rooms. 

  ### Group Team (Outside Team) - Alternative Guide
- Select one person to move shapes once the teams are split. This person is the "Mover".
- The other two are on add clear. Prioritize Unstoppable champs as soon as they spawn. 
- Anyone can kill Knights, but only the "Mover" should be picking up the shapes they drop
- The mover listens to the callouts from the solo team. (Left to Right)
- You want to make sure the 3 statues in the outside room are holding 3d shapes that do not contain what the inside team shape is holding
- Example:
  - Inside Middle Statue is holding a 2D circle
  - Mover's goal is to make the middle statue hold a 3d shape that does not contain a circle,  so in this case. Square and Triangle
- The best way to solve this is by doing one statue at a time
- This should allow you to only have to solve two statues. 
- If you solve the left, then solve the right, the middle will be guaranteed to be correct
- #### Solving LEFT statue
  - Take note of what shape the inside team said was holding for that statue
    - Example: Inside team said **LEFT** statue was holding a circle
    - Example: The outside **LEFT** statue is holding a cone (circle + triangle)
    - Note: We dont want a circle on this statue, you want square + triangle
  - Step 1: Kill the knight that drops the unwanted shape (Example: circle)
  - Step 2: Pick up unwanted shape
  - Step 3: Deposit (Dissect) unwanted shape on **LEFT** statue 
  - Step 4: Kill a knight that has the shape you want instead (Example: square)
  - Step 5: Pick up wanted shape
  - Step 6: Deposit wanted shape into one of the two statues you are **NOT** solving
    - Note: Make sure the statue you are deposting actually has that shape. 
      - If you try to deposit a square on a statue that contains a sphere, it wont work. 
      - If that is the case, then just deposit on the other statue you arent solving
  - Depositing the wanted shape, should then swap those two 2D shapes between the two statues
  - If you did this correctly, the **LEFT** statue should be solved!
- #### Solving RIGHT statue
  - Take note of what shape the inside team said was holding for that statue
    - Example: Inside team said **RIGHT** statue was holding a triangle
    - Example: The outside **RIGHT** statue is holding a prism (square + triangle)
    - Note: We dont want a triangle on this statue, you want square + circle
  - Step 1: Kill the knight that drops the unwanted shape (Example: triangle)
  - Step 2: Pick up unwanted shape
  - Step 3: Deposit (Dissect) unwanted shape on **RIGHT** statue
  - Step 4: Kill a knight that has the shape you want instead (Example: circle)
  - Step 5: Pick up wanted shape
  - Step 6: Deposit wanted shape into the **MIDDLE** statue
  - Depositing the wanted shape, should then swap those two 2D shapes between the two statues
  - If you did this correctly, the **RIGHT** statue should be solved
- #### Solving MIDDLE statue
  - You dont need to if the others are correct :)
- Let inside team know they can walk through the wall now
- Extra Notes:
  - Each Knight drops a specific shape
    - Left Knight drops Circle
    - Middle Knight drops Triangle
    - Right Knight drops Square

### Regroup
- By this time both Teams should have sorted out their shapes and the Solo Team should be able to exit their respective rooms.
- Unstoppable orges spawn with enemies. Kill them. 
- Everyone regroups at the spawn where the 6 pedestals are and spreads out. 
- The Witness will kill/freeze 5 of the 6 guardians in the raid.
- While the 5 members are dead they need to determine which Ghosts need to go to which pedestal.
- Each dead guardian can only see 1 statue. Everyone needs to call out which guardian's statue they see at which pedestal.
- THE ALIVE PLAYER SHOULD NOT PICK UP A GHOST TILL IT'S DETERMINED WHERE ALL STATUES ARE.
- Once it's determined where Ghosts go the remaining player picks up the first Ghost and deposits it at the correct pedestal.
- As team members are revived they can assist with revives until the whole team is up again.
