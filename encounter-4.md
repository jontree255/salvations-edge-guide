## Encounter
- The raid group will be randomly split into two teams.
  - 3 Players will be put into separate rooms as solos. The Solo Team
  - The remaining 3 players will stay in the spawn room. The Group Team.
- Periodically throughout the encounter the Witness will kill and freeze random players.
  - To revive a player you must pick up their Ghost and take it to the corresponding statue of the guardian.
  - The person who picks up the Ghost CANNOT see which statue is where. The dead Guardians can. 
  - Dead guardians must direct the player who picks up the Ghost to the correct statue. 
  - If deposited in the correct statue the player will unfreeze where they were and can continue.

### Solo Team
- Look to the back of the room for the 3 statues.
- Call out to the Group the order of the shapes from left to right. They will be the same for all members of the Solo team.
- Identify which statue is you and which shape the statue is holding. 
- You are trying to get the other two shapes your statue is NOT holding.
  - To make this easier you want to first get only the shape your statue IS holding to drop in your room.
- Look at the back wall which will switch between two shapes. This indicates which shapes are dropping in your room. 
- Kill the knights that spawn to make them drop a shape. Don't kill them unless you need a shape. 
- Take the shape to the corresponding statue holding it and give it to that staute.
  - This sends the shape to that person's room. 
  - If your back wall is showing your statue's shape and one other shape you only need to kill one knight and deposit one shape
  - If you don't see your statue's shape on the back wall you'll need to kill two knights and deposit two shapes. 
- Kill Orges to spawn more knights. 
- Once each solo player's wall is only showing their statue's shape it's time to give them to the other players. 
- Kill a knight and give the shape to the other two statues NOT holding that shape. 
- Now each solo player's room should be dropping the two shapes their statue DOES NOT have. 
- Each player kills two knights to get both shapes and form the 3D object they need to exit their room.

### Group Team
- Select one person to move shapes once the teams are split. The "Mover".
- The other two are on add clear and/or Ghost duty. They must also deal with Unstoppable champs. 
- The mover listens to the callouts from the solo team. 
- Mover must look at the 3 statues in the back of their room that are holding 3D objects. 
- The mover must create the 3D objects on the 3 statues in the back that DO NOT contain the shape that the statues of the Solo Team have.
- Example:
   - Solo team has Triangle, Circle, Square from left to right
   - The Mover needs to create Cylinder, Prisim, Cone from left to right. 
- The mover creates new shapes by SUBTRACTING from a 3D object and SWAPPING it to another 3D object.
- To choose which shape to subtract, kill a knight and pick up their shape. 
- Example:
  - Solo team has Triangle, Circle, Square from left to right.
  - Mover has Prisim, Cone, Sphere from left to right. 
  - The Mover needs to create Cylinder, Prisim, Cone from left to right.
  - Left statue cannot have a triangle, middle statue cannot have a circle, and right statue cannot have a square. 
  - Mover kills a knight and picks up Circle.
  - Mover deposits Circle on the Right at Sphere
  - Mover kills another knight and picks up Triangle
  - Mover deposits Triangle on the Left at Prisim
  - Left and Right swap deposited shapes. Left is now a Cylinder and Right is now a Cone
  - Mover kills another knight and picks up Circle.
  - Mover deposits Circle at Middle on Cone.
  - Mover kills another knight and picks up Square.
  - Mover deposits Square at Middle to swap Circle and Square to make a Prism.
  - All statues have proper 3D objects now. 

### Regroup
- By this time both Teams should have sorted out their shapes and the Solo Team should be able to exit their respective rooms.
- Everyone regroups at the spawn where the 6 pedestals are and spreads out. 
- The Witness will kill/freeze 5 of the 6 guardians in the raid.
- While the 5 members are dead they need to determine which Ghosts need to go to which pedestal. 
- Once it's determined where Ghosts go the remaining player picks up the first Ghost and deposits it at the correct pedestal.
- As team members are revived they can assist with revives until the whole team is up again.
